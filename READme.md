### Convolution Neural Networks
After being introduced to neural nets, optimization, and the matrix mathematics behind machine learning, I, along with 2 other students, created a simple lesson/breakdown of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the purpose of educating others.

The following notebook consists of:
  - An introduction to CNNs
  - An overview of fundamental topics such as:
    - Convolution
    - Pooling
    - CNN Architecture
  - Some trivial questions on CNN concepts
  - A coding activity that runs through the convolution process, classifying voer 1000 images from the MNIST dataset
